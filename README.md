# Lunar-data-fusion
Deep learning model for lunar feature recognition, data preprocessing and automated database creation for nonexclusive use with the NASA-USGS PILOT platform (https://pilot.wr.usgs.gov).

The MATLAB code is coming.

In terms of setting up the database on your own computer, make sure to add your parent file path has the origin variable in the workflow script.

The global maps must be downloaded from http://imbrium.mit.edu/EXTRAS/SLDEM2015/TILES/JP2/ before running workflow script; recommend downloading all global maps and putting them in the global maps folder.
